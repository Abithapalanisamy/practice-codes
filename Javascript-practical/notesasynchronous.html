 <!-- ! Promise  -->
 <!-- Promise is an object in js which is used to handle asynchronous result(completion or failure) of an ynchronous operation 
 Promise is like a placeholder for a value which might not be immediately available (the value which ll come in future )
 whenever we make a http request to the server , server will return a promise as a response  ! state of the promise 
 !1. pending -> it is the initial state of the promise , Neither the promise is fulfilled nor it is jected 
 !2. fulfilled -> we have received the response successfully from the promise 
 !3. rejected -> if the request has been rejected , due to some error on client side or server side  ! methods to handle the promise 
 1. then -> then method is used to handle the fulfilled state of the promise 
 2. catch -> catch method is used to handle the rejected state of the promise 
 3. finally -> finally method will be executed in both the state , if promise is resolved or rejected  -->

<!-- creating a promise  -->
let p1 = new Promise((res , rej)=>{
    let random = Math.round(Math.random()*10)
    console.log(random);
    
    setTimeout(()=>{
        if(random>4){
         res([20 , 30 , 40])
        }else{ 
            rej('This is the error from server')
        }
    } , 5000)
})
console.log(p1);
p1.then((data)=>{
    console.log('Then method');
    console.log(data);
}).catch((err)=>{
    console.log('Catch');
    console.log(err);
}).finally(()=>{
    console.log('finally');
})
